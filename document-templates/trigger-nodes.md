# How to use this template

1. Make a new branch. If working on an internal ticket, include it at the start of the name. For example, DOC-123-feature-summary.
2. Create a new file, or find the file you want to edit, in integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/. If creating a new file, pay attention to the naming conventions: it should match the node name in the codex file. For example, in the Active Campaign trigger node, the codex file (https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/ActiveCampaign/ActiveCampaignTrigger.node.json) reads: `"node": "n8n-nodes-base.activeCampaignTrigger"`. So the app node file name is n8n-nodes-base.activeCampaignTrigger.
3. Copy the template into the file (don't copy this comment).
4. Placeholder text is in _italic_ or between <>. Make sure to replace it! 
5. Before publishing, delete any comments.

You can find more info on working with the docs project in the README: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/main/README.md

<!-- 
The title should be the name of the integration, plus "trigger". For example, "Asana trigger"
Match the brand name exactly. For example, GitHub NOT Github
-->
# <Name> trigger

_Briefly summarize the service. This should be one or two sentences, and can often be copied from a product's own website._
