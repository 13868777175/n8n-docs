# Using console.log or print in the Code node

You can use `console.log()` or `print()` in the Code node to help when writing and debugging your code.

## console.log (JavaScript)

For example, copy the following code into a Code node, then open your console and run the node:

```js
let a = "apple";
console.log(a);
```
