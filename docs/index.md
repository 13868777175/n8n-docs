# Welcome

This is the documentation for [n8n](https://n8n.io/), a [fair-code](http://faircode.io) licensed node-based workflow automation tool.

It covers everything from setup to usage and development. It is a work in progress and all [contributions](/contributing/) are welcome.

## What is n8n?

n8n (pronounced n-eight-n) helps you to connect any app with an API with any other, and manipulate its data with little or no code. n8n is:

* Customizable: highly flexible workflows and the option to build custom nodes.
* Convenient: use our Desktop app or npm to try out n8n, and our Cloud hosting option if you want us to handle the infrastructure.
* Privacy-focused: self-host n8n for maximum privacy and security.

## Where to start

### Up and running
