# User management

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance. It includes:

* Login and password management
* Support for adding and removing users
* Two account types: owner and member

User management is available for self-hosted n8n. It isn't currently available for Cloud.

## Setup

There are three stages to set up user management in n8n:

1. Configure your n8n instance to use your SMTP server.
2. Start n8n and follow the setup steps in the app.
3. Invite users.

### Step one: SMTP

You need an SMTP server for user management to send invites and password resets. Get the following information from your SMTP provider:

* Server name
* Port
* SMTP username
* SMTP password
* SMTP sender name

To set up SMTP with n8n, configure the following environment variables for your n8n instance:

| Variable | Type | Value |
| -------- | ---- | ----- |
| `N8N_SMTP_EMAIL_MODE` | string | smtp |
| `N8N_SMTP_HOST` | string | _your_server_name_:_your_smtp_port_ |
| `N8N_SMTP_USER` | string | _your_smtp_username_ |
| `N8N_SMTP_PASSWORD` | string | _your_smtp_password_ |
| `N8N_SMTP_SENDER` | string | _your_smtp_sender_name_ |

If your n8n instance is already running, you need to restart it to enable the new SMTP settings.

### Step two: in-app setup

When you set up user management for the first time, you create an owner account.

1. Open n8n. The app displays a signup screen.
2. Enter your details. Your password must be at least eight characters, including at least one number and one capital letter.
3. Click **Next**. n8n logs you in with your new owner account.

### Step three: invite users

You can now invite other people to your n8n instance. 

1. Sign in with your owner account.
2. Click your user icon > **Settings**. n8n opens your **Personal settings** page.
3. Click **Users** to go to the **Users** page.
4. Click **Invite**.
5. Enter the new user's email address.
6. Click **Invite user**. n8n sends an email with a link for the new user to join.

## Manage users

The **Users** page shows all users, including ones with pending invitations. You can:

* Delete a user: 
  1. Click the menu icon by the user you want to delete.
  2. Confirm you want to delete them.
  3. If they are an active user, choose whether to copy their workflow data and credentials to a new user, or permanently delete their workflows and credentials.
* Resend an invitation to a pending user: click the menu icon by the user, then click **Resend invite**.

## Account types

There are two account types, owner and member. The account type affects the user permissions and access.

* Owner: this is the account that set up user management. There is one owner account for each n8n instance. You can't transfer ownership.  
  The owner can:
    * Add and remove users
    * See all workflows
    * Delete tags
* Members: these are normal n8n users.  
  Members can:
    * See all workflow tags, create new tags, and assign tags to their workflows. Members can't delete tags.
    * Change their own password.
    * See their own workflows.

::: tip Create a member-level account for the owner
We recommend that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see all workflows, but there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.

## Skipping or disabling user management

You don't have to use n8n's user management feature. You can:

* Leave it enabled, but choose to skip the setup step. You can use n8n as normal. If you want to set up user management later, go to **Settings** > **Users**.
* Disable the feature completely using the `N8N_USER_MANAGEMENT_DISABLED` environment variable. Setting this environment variable to `true` completely hides the feature in your n8n instance.
