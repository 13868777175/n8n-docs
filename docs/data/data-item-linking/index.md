# Data item linking

An item is a single piece of data. Nodes receive one or more items, operate on them, and output new items. Each item links back to previous items. 

You need to be understand this behavior if you're:

* Building a programmatic-style node that implements complex behaviors with its input and output data.
* Using the Function node or expressions editor to access data from earlier items in the workflow. Refer to [code examples](/code-examples/) to find working examples of how to do this in both the expressions editor and the Function node.

This section provides:

* A conceptual overview of [item linking scenarios](/data/data-item-linking/item-linking-scenarios/). 
* Information on [Item linking for node creators](/data/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building/).
* Support for end users who need to [follow the data path](/data/data-item-linking/item-linking-users/) to retrieve item data from previous nodes.
* Guidance on troubleshooting [errors](/data/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).
