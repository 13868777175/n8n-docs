# Chat with a Google Sheet using AI

[View and use the workflow](https://[[ page.meta.workflowURL ]]){:target=_blank .external-link}

Use n8n to bring your own data to AI. This workflow uses the [Chat Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) to provide the chat interface, and the [Custom n8n Workflow Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) to call a second workflow which queries Google Sheets.
