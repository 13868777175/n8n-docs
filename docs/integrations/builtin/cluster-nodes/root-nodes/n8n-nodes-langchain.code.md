# LangChain Code

The LangChain Code node allows you to import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the LangChain Code node, and links to more resources.

<!--
!!! note "Examples and templates"
	For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [LangChain integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/langchain/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.

* **Execute**: code that uses the main node input and output connections. You must create these connections in **Inputs** and **Outputs**.
* **SupplyData**: code that uses an output other than the main connector.
