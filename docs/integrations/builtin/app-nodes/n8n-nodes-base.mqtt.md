# MQTT

Use the MQTT node to automate work in MQTT, and integrate MQTT with other applications. n8n supports transporting messages with MQTT.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the MQTT node supports and links to more resources.

/// note | Credentials
Refer to [MQTT credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mqtt/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 
///

/// note | Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [MQTT integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/mqtt/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.

## Operations

Use the MQTT node to send a message. You can set the message topic, and choose whether to send the node input data as part of the message.
