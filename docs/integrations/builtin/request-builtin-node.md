# Request a built-in node

## Make a feature request

The best way to request a built-in node is to post it in the n8n Community Forum. You can upvote an existing post or create a new post in the [Feature Request > Nodes category](https://community.n8n.io/c/feature-requests/nodes/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Submit a built-in node

If you've created a node you'd like to add as an official node in n8n, open a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n){:target=_blank .external-link}. An n8n team member will review it. Note that new nodes take time to review and this may take some time. 

## Publish a community node

For a faster way to make your node available, create a community node and publish it on npm. Refer to [Building community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/build-community-nodes/) for details. Note that these nodes are available [only for self-hosted users and not for n8n Cloud users](/choose-n8n/).
