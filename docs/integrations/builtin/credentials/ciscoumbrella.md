# _Name_ credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate when using the HTTP Request node to make a [Custom API call](/integrations/custom-operations/).

## Prerequisites

_Include info on services they need to sign up for_

## Related resources

<!-- add a link to the service's documentation. This should usually go direct to the API credential docs -->
Refer to [_Name_'s documentation](){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.


<!-- 
TODO
If this is a credential-only node, add a link to the node page on n8n's website. For example: https://n8n.io/integrations/356-gmail/ 
View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/_Name_/){:target=_blank .external-link} on n8n's website.
