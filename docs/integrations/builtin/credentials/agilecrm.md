## Using API key

In Agile CRM, you can access your API key through **Admin Settings > Developers & API >** [**REST API key**](https://github.com/agilecrm/rest-api?tab=readme-ov-file#api-key){:target=_blank .external-link}. Use the REST API key, your registered email, and your Agile CRM subdomain (for instance, n8n) with your Agile CRM node credentials in n8n.
