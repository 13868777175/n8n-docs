!!! note "Note for n8n Cloud users"
    For the following nodes, you can authenticate by entering the **Credentials Name** and selecting **Sign in with Google** in the OAuth section to connect your Google account to n8n:

    * [Google Calendar](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googleCalendar/)
    * [Google Contacts](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googleContacts/)
    * [Google Sheets](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets/)
    * [Google Tasks](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googleTasks/)


## Set up OAuth

You need a [Google Cloud Platform project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/marketplace/create-gcp-project){:targe=_blank .external-link} for these steps.

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials){:target=_blank .external-link} and make sure you're in the project you want to use.

2. Select **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID**. If you're creating OAuth credentials for the first time, you must [configure the consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en&ref_topic=3473162){:target=_blank .external-link}.

5. Select **CREATE**.
6. Enable each Google service API that you want to use:

	1. If using Google Perspective or Google Ads: [Request API Access for Perspective](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started){:targe=_blank .external-link} or a [Developer Token for Ads](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token){:targe=_blank .external-link}.

In n8n:

1. Enter your new **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Google Cloud Console in the credentials modal.
2. Select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.
3. **Save** your new credentials.


## Troubleshooting

### Google hasn't verified this app

If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate. However, if you're using credentials that were generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), do the following in Google Cloud:

1. Select **Advanced**.
2. Select **Go to CREDENTIALS_NAME (unsafe)**. `CREDENTIALS_NAME` is the name of the credentials created by the third party.
3. Grant the requested permissions.
