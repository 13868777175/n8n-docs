# Typed HTTP credential

A typed HTTP credential is a credential associated with a particular platform that you can use with the HTTP Request node.

(as opposed to generic creds - so you can use node-specific creds with http req node)

For example: you create an Asana credential, for use with the Asana node. Later, you want to perfom an operation that isn't supported by the Asana node, using Asana's API. You can use your existing Asana credential in the HTTP Request node to perform the operation.

## Supported nodes

* Action Network API
* AcuityScheduling OAuth2 API
* Asana API
* Asana OAuth2 API
