# n8n Community Node blocklist

n8n maintains a blocklist of Community Nodes. You can't install any node on this list.

n8n may add Community Nodes to the blocklist for a range of reasons, including:

* The node is intentionally malicious
* It's of very low quality (low enough to be harmful)


If you are a Community Node creator whose node is on the blocklist, and you believe this is a mistake, contact [hello@n8n.io](mailto: hello@n8n.io).
