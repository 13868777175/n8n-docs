# Source control environment variables

/// note | File-based configuration
You can provide a [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for n8n. You can also append `_FILE` to certain variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Variables that support this have the "/`_FILE`" option listed below.
///

n8n uses Git-based source control to support environments. Refer to [Source control and environments](/source-control-environments/setup/) for more information on how to link a Git repository to an n8n instance and configure your source control.

| Variable | Type  | Default  | Description |
| :------- | :---- | :------- | :---------- |
| `N8N_SOURCECONTROL_DEFAULT_SSH_KEY_TYPE` | String | `ed25519` | Set to `rsa` to make RSA the default SSH key type for [Source control setup](/source-control-environments/setup/). |
