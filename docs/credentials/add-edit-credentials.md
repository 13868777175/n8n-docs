# Create and edit credentials

You can get to the credential modal by either: 

* Opening the left menu, then selecting **Credentials** > **Add Credential** and browsing for the service you want to connect to.
* Selecting **Create New** in the **Credential** dropdown in a node.

Once in the credential modal, enter the details required by your service. Refer to your service's page in the [credentials library](/integrations/builtin/credentials/) for guidance.

When you save a credential, n8n tests it to confirm it works.

/// note | Credentials naming
n8n names new credentials "*node name* account" by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app or service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.
