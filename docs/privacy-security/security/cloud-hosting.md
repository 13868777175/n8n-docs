# Cloud hosting

n8n cloud uses [Microsoft Azure](https://aws.amazon.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} for hosting. The physical hardware powering n8n, and the data stored by the platform, is hosted in the Azure Germany West Central data center in Frankfurt. Microsoft controls and secures this. You can read more about [Azure’s security practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/physical-security){:target=_blank .external-link} and [compliance certifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/compliance/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

n8n further secures access to Azure resources through a series of controls, including: 

* Using multi-factor authentication to access Azure
* Hosting services within a private network inaccessible to the public internet
