# Retention and deletion of personal identifiable data

PID (personal identifiable data) is data that's personal to you and would identify you as an individual.

## n8n Cloud

### PID retention

n8n only retains data for as long as necessary to provide the core service. 

For n8n Cloud, n8n stores your workflow code, credentials, and other data indefinitely, until you choose to delete it or close your account. The platform stores execution data according toÂ the retention rules on your account.

n8n deletes most internal application logs and logs tied to subprocessors within 30 days. The company retains a subset of logs for longer periods where required for security investigations. [TODO: what about analytics]

### PID deletion

If you choose to delete your n8n account, n8n deletes all customer data and event data associated with your account. n8n deletes customer data in backups within 30 days.

## Self-hosted

Self-hosted users should have their own PID policy and data deletion processes. Refer to [What you can do](/privacy-security/what-you-can-do/) for more information.
