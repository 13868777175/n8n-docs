# GDPR

## Data protection addendum

n8n is considered both a Controller and a Processor as defined by the GDPR. As a Processor, n8n implements policies and practices that secure the personal data you send to the platform, and includes a [Data Protection Addendum](https://n8n.io/legal/){:target=_blank .external-link} as part of the company's standard [Terms of Service](https://n8n.io/legal/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

The n8n Data Protection Addendum includes the [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en){:target=_blank .external-link}. These clarify how n8n handles your data, and they update n8n's GDPR policies to cover the latest standards set by the European Commission.

You can find a list of n8n subprocessors [here](https://n8n.io/legal/){:target=_blank .external-link}.
