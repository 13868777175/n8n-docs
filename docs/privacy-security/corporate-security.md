## Corporate security

n8n follows best practices for corporate security.

### Background checks

n8n performs background checks on all new hires.

### Workstation security

n8n provides hardware to all new hires. These machines run a local agent that sets configuration of the operating system to hardened standards, including:

- Automatic OS updates
- Hard disk encryption
- Anti-malware software
- Screen lock

and more.

### System access

n8n grants employees access to systems on a least-privilege basis. This means that employees only have access to the data they need to perform their job. System access is reviewed quarterly, on any change in role, or upon termination.

### Security training

Employees receive privacy and security training during onboarding as well as on an ongoing basis. All employees are required to read and sign n8n's comprehensive information security policy covering the security, availability, and confidentiality of n8n services.
