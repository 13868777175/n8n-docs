# Introduction

Welcome to the n8n Course Level 2!

## Is this course right for me?

This course is for you if you:

- Want to automate somewhat complex business processes.
- Want to dive deeper into n8n after taking the Level 1 course.

## What will I learn?

The focus in this course is on working with data. You will learn how to:

- Use the data structure of n8n correctly.
- Process different data types (for example, XML, HTML, date, time, and binary data).
- Merge data from different sources (for example, a database, spreadsheet, or CRM).
- Use functions and JavaScript code in the [*Function node*](integrations/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function/).
- Deal with error workflows and workflow errors.

You will learn all this by completing short practical exercises after the theoretical explanations, and building a business workflow step-by-step.

## What do I need to get started?

To follow along this course (at a comfortable pace) you will need the following:

- [n8n set up](https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/installation/). This course was developed on n8n version 0.161.
- basic knowledge of n8n (for example, key components and concepts). We strongly recommend taking our [Level 1 course](/courses/level-one/) prior to this one.

## How long does it take to complete the course?

Completing the course should take around two hours. You do not have to complete it in one go, feel free to take breaks and resume whenever you are ready.

## Do I get a certificate?

We believe all good works deserve recognition. If you successfully complete the course, we will email you a **recognition badge** that you can share with your peers to showcase your n8n skills. To get your n8n badge, you need to complete the following milestones:

✅ Send an automated email containing two binary files.<br/>
✅ Send an automated message in a Slack channel.<br/>
✅ Pass the quiz (theory and practice) at the end of the course.
