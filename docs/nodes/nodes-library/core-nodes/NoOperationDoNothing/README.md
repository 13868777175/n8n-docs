# No Operation, do nothing

The No Operation, do nothing node is used when you don't want to perform any operations. The node makes the workflow cleaner and helps in a better visual understanding of the workflow. For example, checkout the [Creating Your First Workflow](../../../../getting-started/creating-your-first-workflow.md).
