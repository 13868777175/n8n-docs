# Error Trigger

Error Trigger node triggers the workflow when another workflow has an error. As opposed to other workflows with a trigger node, you wonâ€™t have to activate the workflow when using the Error Trigger node. Once a workflow fails, this node automagically gets details about the failed workflow and the error workflow gets triggered.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to receive updates when another workflow fails using the Error Trigger node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/662) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following node.
- [Error Trigger]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
