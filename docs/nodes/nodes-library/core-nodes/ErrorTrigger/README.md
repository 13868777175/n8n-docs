# Error Trigger

Error Trigger node triggers the workflow when another workflow has an error. Once a workflow fails, this node gets details about the failed workflow and the error workflow gets triggered.

::: tip ðŸ’¡ Keep in mind
1. If a workflow is using the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
2. If you want to receive error updates for a workflow, make sure that you select the 'Error Workflow' in the ***Workflow Settings***.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send an SMS when a workflow fails, using the Error Trigger node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/665) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Error Trigger]()
- [Twilio](../../../nodes-library/nodes/Twilio/README.md)

The final workflow should look like the following image.
