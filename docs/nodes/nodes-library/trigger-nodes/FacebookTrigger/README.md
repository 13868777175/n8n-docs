## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to receive updates when a user updates their profile on Facebook using the Facebook Trigger node. It also allows you to send a message in Mattermost about the update. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/769) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Facebook Trigger]()
- [Set](../../core-nodes/Set/README.md)
- [Mattermost](../../nodes/Mattermost/README.md)

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Facebook Trigger node

The Facebook Trigger node will trigger the workflow when a user updates their profile on Facebook.

2. Select 'User' from the ***Object*** dropdown list.
3. Enter your app ID in the ***App ID*** field.
3. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node returns the updated information of the user from Facebook. This output is passed on to the next node in the workflow.
