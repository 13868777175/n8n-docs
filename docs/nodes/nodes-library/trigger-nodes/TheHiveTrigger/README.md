2. Add configuration lines to application.conf (TheHive configuration file)
    ```
    notification.webhook.endpoints = [
        {
            name: WEBHOOK_NAME
            url: WEBHOOK_URL
            version: 0
            wsConfig: {}
            includedTheHiveOrganisations: ["ORGANIZATION_NAME"]
            excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
        }
    ]
    ```
3. Enable notifications using this curl command
    ```

    curl -XPUT -uTHEHIVE_USERNAME:THEHIVE_PASSWORD -H 'Content-type: application/json' THEHIVE_URL/api/config/organisation/notification -d '
    {
        "value": [
            {
