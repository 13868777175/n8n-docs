## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to receive updates when a form is submitted in MailerLite using the MailerLite Trigger node and send an SMS confirmation to the submitter. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/721) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following node.
- [MailerLite Trigger]()
- [Twilio](../../nodes/Twilio/README.md)

The final workflow should look like the following image.
