## FAQs

### How can I send more than 30 messages per second?

The Telegram API has a [limitation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#broadcasting-to-users) to send only 30 messages per second. However, you can do the following
- [Split In Batches]() node: Use the Split in Batches node to get at most 30 chat IDs.
- [Function]() node: Use the Function node to wait for a few seconds before sending a message to the next batch of chat IDs.

You can also use this [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/772).

### How do I add a bot to a Telegram channel?

1. In the Telegram app, access the target channel and tap on the channel name.
2. Make sure that the channel name is labeled as "public channel".
3. Tap on ***Administrators*** and then on ***Add Admin***.
4. Search for the username of the bot and select it.
5. Tap on the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.

### How do I get a Chat ID?

There are two ways to get the Chat ID in Telegram. 

- Using the [Telegram Trigger]() node: On successful execution, the Telegram Trigger node returns a Chat ID. You can use the Telegram Trigger node in your workflow to get a Chat ID.
- Use the `@RawDataBot`: The `@RawDataBot` returns the raw data of the chat with a Chat ID. Invite the `@RawDataBot` to your channel/group, and upon joining, it will output a Chat ID along with other information. Be sure to remove the `@RawDataBot` from your group/channel afterward.
