[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub and Bitbucket.

## Basic Operations

- Build
    - Cancel a build
    - Get a build
    - Get all builds
    - Restart a build
    - Trigger a build

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to trigger a build using the TravisCI node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/658) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [TravisCI]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
