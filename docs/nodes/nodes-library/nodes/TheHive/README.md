# TheHive

[TheHive](https://thehive-project.org/) is a scalable 4-in-1 open source and free security incident response platform designed to make life easier for SOCs, CSIRTs, CERTs and any information security practitioner. Thanks to Cortex, the powerful analysis engine It offers an easy way to investigate security incidents, plus you can actively respond to the threats and interact with other parties using Cortex responders.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a case in TheHive. You can also find the [workflow]() on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [TheHive]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

![A workflow with the TheHive node](./workflow.png)

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. TheHive node

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the TheHive node. You can find out how to do that [here](../../../credentials/TheHive/README.md).
2. Choose 'Case' in *Resource* field.
3. Choose 'Create' in *Operation* field
4. Enter case title in *Title* field. 
5. Enter case description in *Description* field.
6. Choose case severity in *Severity* field.
7. Choose case start date in *Start Date* field.
8. Enter case owner in *Owner* field
9. Toggle *Flag* field
10. Choose case TLP level in *TLP* field.
11. Enter case tags (separated by comma) in *Tags* field.
12. (Optional) Add any additional attributes, and provide their values. 
13. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.
