## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to extract information from an image of a receipt using the Mindee node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/702) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [HTTP Request](../../core-nodes/HTTPRequest/README.md)
- [Mindee]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The Start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.


### 2. HTTP Request (GET)

This example workflow uses the HTTP Request node to make a GET request to get the image of the receipt. You can also use other nodes, for example, the [Box](../../nodes/Box/README.md) node, to get the image of the receipt you want to use.
::: v-pre
1. Enter a URL of a file in the ***URL*** field.
2. Select 'File' from the ***Response Format*** dropdown list.
3. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.
:::

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the HTTP Request node gets the file from the URL. We will pass this data to the Mindee node.

### 3. Mindee node (predict: receipt)

This node will get the image of the receipt from the HTTP Request node and extract the information from it.
1. Select 'Receipt' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list. 
2.  First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Mindee node. You can find out how to enter credentials for this node [here](../../../credentials/Mindee/README.md).
3. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the workflow.

In the screenshot below, you will observe that the node extracts the information from the image it got from the HTTP Request node.
