# Discord

[Discord](https://discord.com/) is a voice, video, and text communications platform for groups. Discord allows users to programatically send messages using webhooks.

The Discord Node does not require Authentication, but you must have access to a channel's settings to use webhooks.

## Basic Operations

- Send messages in a Discord Channel

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send a message to a Discord channel using webhooks. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/410) on this website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start)
- Discord

The final workflow should look like the following image.
