# Airtable

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet. The fields in an Airtable table are similar to cells in a spreadsheet, but have types such as 'checkbox', 'phone number', and 'drop-down list', and can reference file attachments like images.

## Basic Operations

- Append the data to a table
- Delete data from a table
- List data from a table
- Read data from a table
- Update data in a table


## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to insert and list data from a table in Airtable. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/601) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [Set](../../core-nodes/Set/README.md)
- [Airtable]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
