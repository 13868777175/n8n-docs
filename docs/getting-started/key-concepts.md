# Key Concepts

## Workflow

Automations built in n8n are called workflows. A workflow is made up of nodes, which can bring in data, perform an action on the data, and finally load the data to a destination when it's ready.

## Expression

## Items
Data sent from one node to another is sent as an array of JSON objects. Each element in this collection is called an **Item**. A node performs its action on each item of incoming data.
