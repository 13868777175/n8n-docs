# Cloud admin dashboard

Instance owners can access the admin dashboard to manage their Cloud instance. This is where you can upgrade your n8n version.

## Access the dashboard from the app

## Access the dashboard if the app is offline

If your instance is down, you can still access the admin dashboard. When you log in to the app, n8n asks you if you want a magic link to access your dashboard. Select **Send magic link**, then check your email for the link.
