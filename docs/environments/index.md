# Create environments

!!! info "Feature availability"
	* Available on Enterprise.
	* You need access to the n8n instance owner account to set up source control, and to push work to Git. All users can pull.

n8n uses Git-based source control to support environments. Linking your n8n instances to a Git repository lets you create multiple n8n environments, backed by Git branches.
