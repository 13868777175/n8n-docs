# Workflow history

!!! info "Feature availability"
	* Full workflow history available on Enterprise Cloud and Self-hosted.
	* Last five workflow versions available for Cloud Pro users.

Use workflow history to view and restore previous versions of your workflows.

!!! note "Workflow history and execution history"
	Don't confuse workflow history with the [Workflow-level executions list](/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/).

	Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](/workflows/executions/debug/) in your current workflow.

	Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.
