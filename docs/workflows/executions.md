# Executions

An execution is a single run of a workflow.

Select **Executions** <span class="inline-image">![Executions menu icon](/_images/common-icons/executions-menu.png)</span> to view your executions history. n8n opens the **Workflow Executions** modal. You can then open and view individual executions.
