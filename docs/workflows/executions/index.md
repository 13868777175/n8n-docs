# Executions

An execution is a single run of a workflow.

n8n provides two execution lists:

* [Workflow-level executions](/workflows/executions/single-workflows-executions/): this execution list shows the executions for a single workflow.
* [All executions](/workflows/executions/all-executions/): this list shows all executions for all your workflows.

n8n supports [adding custom data to executions](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/).
