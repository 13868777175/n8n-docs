# Code in n8n

n8n is a low-code tool. This means you can do a lot without code, then add code when needed.

## JavaScript in your workflows

There are two places in your workflows where you can use code:

<div class="grid-cards-vertical cards" markdown>

- __Expressions__

	Use expressions to transform data in your nodes. You can use JavaScript in expressions, as well as n8n's [Built-in methods and variables](/code-examples/methods-variables-reference/) and [Data transformation functions](/code-examples/expressions/data-transformation-functions/).

- __Code node__

	The Code node allows you to add JavaScript to your workflow.

## Other developer resources

- __The n8n API__

	n8n provides an API, allowing you to programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the GUI. There's an [n8n API node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to access the API in your workflows.

- __Self-host__

	You can self-host n8n. This keeps your data on your own infrastructure.
