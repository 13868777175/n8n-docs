* **Use Memory Locking**: whether to lock the model in memory to prevent swapping. This can improve performance but requires enough available memory.
* **Use Memory Mapping**: whether to use memory mapping for loading the model. This can reduce memory usage but may impact performance. Recommended to keep enabled.
* **Load Vocabulary Only**: whether to only load the model vocabulary without the weights. Useful for testing tokenization.
* **Output Format**: specifies the format of the API response. Choose between **Default** and **JSON**.
