## Node operations: Triggers and Actions

When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:

* Triggers start a workflow. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected.
* Actions perform steps in your workflow. When you select an Action, n8n adds an app node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.
