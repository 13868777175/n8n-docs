## Using the example

To load the template into your n8n instance:

1. Follow this link to [view the workflow on the n8n website](https://[[ page.meta.workflowURL ]]){:target=_blank .external-link}.
1. Read the workflow details on the page.
1. Select **Use workflow** to open the workflow in your cloud instance, or **Copy workflow** to download the workflow JSON and import it into your self-hosted instance.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

* Yellow: notes and information.
* Green: instructions to run the workflow.
* Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
* Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.
